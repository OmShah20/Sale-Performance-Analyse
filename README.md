1. Objective of the Project

The main goals of this project are:

To analyze overall sales performance

To understand monthly, regional, and state-wise sales trends

To identify top customers contributing to revenue

To track year-wise sales growth

This dashboard helps stakeholders quickly understand where sales are coming from and how they are changing over time.

2. Dataset Overview

The dataset contains sales transaction data with fields such as:

Order Date

Sales

Customer Name

State

Region

Order ID

Using this data, I created multiple visualizations and combined them into a single interactive dashboard.

3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

At the top of the dashboard, we have three KPIs:

Total Orders: 4,922

Total Customers: 793

Total Sales: 2,261,537

These KPIs provide a quick summary of overall business performance.

4. Month-wise Sales Analysis

This bar chart shows month-wise sales distribution.

The highest sales occur in November and December, indicating strong performance during the festive or holiday season.

The lowest sales are in January and February, showing a post-holiday dip.

Insight:
Sales are seasonal, with peak demand in Q4 and low performance in Q1.

5. State-wise Sales Analysis

This map visualization represents sales by state.

California is the top-performing state.

New York is the second highest contributor.
